## 1. Project Objective
In this project four service was created to containerise the boxer generator application. Service one 
renders the Jinja2 templates needed to interact with the application. In other words, service one is 
seen as the front-end-api which is responsible for communicating with the other 3 services and rendering 
an HTML template. Service two and three are used to generate objects. In this scenario of the boxer 
generator, service two generates a random boxer name and a random integer between 0-50 for its stamina. 
Service three however only generates a number between 0-50 which represents the boxer’s strength. 
Service four uses the results generated by service two and three to come out with how skilled the boxer 
is. So, if the boxer was Gennady Golovkin with a stamina of 35 and a strength of 48; service four 
determines that his level will be World Class which will be viewed in the front-end.

## 2. Project Planning
Perhaps one of the key aspects of the project as the planning can inform the developer on 
what is there to implement, the user interaction with the application and what risks you may 
be faced with. But mainly a developer must keep track of what they are doing by using a 
project tracker of some sort.

### Project Tracker ###
There are many project management tools which could have been used to track the progress of 
the project; main ones being Jira and the Trello Board. This keeps the developer on track on
what needs to be completed and what is still remaining to complete. In this project the Trello
Board was used as seen in the image below.

### Risk Assessment ###
When developing an application that requires user interaction, several issues which must be
addressed regarding the user’s privacy. A risk assessment had to be done for this project so 
some action could be taken to counteract any risk that could have cropped at anytime. A risk 
assessment also gives the developer a chance to perhaps implement any measures which could be taken 
before any risks actually happen.
