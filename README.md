## 1. Project Objective
In this project four service was created to containerise the boxer generator application. Service one 
renders the Jinja2 templates needed to interact with the application. In other words, service one is 
seen as the front-end-api which is responsible for communicating with the other 3 services and rendering 
an HTML template. Service two and three are used to generate objects. In this scenario of the boxer 
generator, service two generates a random boxer name and a random integer between 0-50 for its stamina. 
Service three however only generates a number between 0-50 which represents the boxerâ€™s strength. 
Service four uses the results generated by service two and three to come out with how skilled the boxer 
is. So, if the boxer was Gennady Golovkin with a stamina of 35 and a strength of 48; service four 
determines that his level will be World Class which will be viewed in the front-end.
